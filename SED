#Imagine you have a .txt file with a lot of emails, looking like this <example1@gmail.com>; example2@gmail.com <example2@gmail.com>; example3@theclosingfirmmex.com
#To much emails and lines, so you want to separe it in lines because the file is actually just ONE string
#You can use SED command to create lines with each email, you can tell that actually email is repeating twice and after a ";" a new email starts
#The code will be
$sed "s/;/\n/g" yourfile.txt
